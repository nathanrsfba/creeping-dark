So, mortal... You have completed your quest.

And with this egg returned to Earth, you might indeed return the sun's light to the surface of your world.

But it will not end the curse of your world... for the true curse is not the plagued skies left by the Dragon... but in the heart of Man. For it was men that summoned her to your world, and the Skies with it. The Curse was not brought by the Dragon, but has dwelt in your own world since the dawn of Man.

Soon, perhaps, you will understand. Soon...
