This directory is a place to collect up the various tools I've thrown together
in the process of making this pack, so they're not cluttering up the actual
config directories

custweap.pl:
A script for generating an Epic Fight Mod configuration file from a simpler
configuration language

nbt2snbt.py: 
A small script to convert between NBT files and SNBT (stringified -- i.e. text
format NBT) files

rendim.py:
A script to mass-rename dimensions in a generated Just Enough Resource profile

updatemods.bat:
A simple batch file to update mods.txt from the content of the mods directory
