Creeping Dark
=============

A standard kitchen-sink tech mod pack. With a bit of exploration. And a bit of
progression. And an artifact hunt quest. But mostly a standard
kitchen-sink tech mod pack.

Also, the sun is slowly being blotted out.

Welcome to Creeping Dark, a mod pack about saving the world. It contains many
of your standard tech, magic, and dimension mods, with a twist. A plague is
slowly covering the sky, blocking the sun. You must find the Sixteen keys to
the end, retrieve the Dragon's egg, and bring it back to the Earth to cure
it. Each tier of technology unlocks a new dimension, and each dimension
unlocks a new tier of technology... and one of the Keys.

While there is a progression mechanic, the recipes are unchanged, with a few
exceptions. Once you've "unlocked" a mod, it works the way it always has.

Questions
---------

Q: I see a console message about objects being summoned?  
A: That's a redstone mechanism I have hidden away in a utility dimension that
recreates certain objects. You can just ignore the message.

Q: The Blaze boss spatial IO isn't loading or regenerating, or the 
'Swamp Magic' frequency isn't showing up in the entangloporter  
A: Apparently my utility dimension gets nuked sometimes. Why? Haven't
a goddamn clue. To fix this, try exiting your world/restarting the server a
couple times. It should get regenerated every time the world loads.

Q: RFTools dimensions don't seem to be generating dimensional shard ore  
A: If the base block of the dimension isn't plain stone, ore generation won't
occur. (This is part of Minecraft's own oregen mechanics.) Try generating
more dimensions until you get one with a base material of stone.

Q: The rocket assembler does nothing when I try to scan or build a rocket  
A: I ran into this once... try making the structure tower a little taller,
even if it looks like you have enough.

Q: When I try to run a standalone server, it runs obscenely slowly  
A: Try adding the 'nogui' option. The GUI really fucks everything up
for god knows what reason

Q: Minibosses aren't spawning when running a standalone server  
A: Edit your server.properties and enable command blocks
